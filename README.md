# Medical Image Analysis

This project demonstrates basic preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and contrast enhancement on a medical image using Python and OpenCV. All analysis is for educational purposes only; no diagnostic claims are made.

## Files in this repository

- `medical_image_analysis.ipynb` : Python Notebook containing all code
- `xray_sample.jpg` : Original medical image
- `image_before.png` / `image_after.png` : Images before and after contrast enhancement
- `image_pixels.csv` : Pixel data of the image
- `image_stats.csv` : Image statistics (Min, Max, Mean)

## Tools Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Power BI (for visualization dashboard)

## Project Steps

1. **Load and preprocess the image**
   - Read the medical image in grayscale
   - Resize to 512x512
   - Apply Gaussian Blur to remove noise

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Check min, max,
